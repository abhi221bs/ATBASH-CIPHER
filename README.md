# ATBASH-CIPHER

This is a comand line application in which each letter of a word is replaced with it's mirror letter. 

This would take a text file as an input and write the output to another text file after ENCRYPTING the content.
I ensured the following:
  - Capitalisation should be retained
  - Non-alphabetic Characters should not be altered
 
 



**Note : Does not include multi-threading and unit testing using PyTest
